From the [`image-spec`](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md)
page:

> This specification defines an OCI Image, consisting of an image manifest, an image index (optional), a set of filesystem layers, and a configuration.

It defines both the content and the layout of these objects. An image is called OCI image (v.s. a docker image) if it satisfies this spec.

Based on my own understanding, the `image-spec` defines the following:

1. Objects/components (JSON, gzip, tar, etc) that are composed of an OCI image: image index, image manifest, image config, layers;
2. How different objects reference each other in a DAG format (e.g., image index -> image manifest -> layer): descriptor;
3. How to identify (and verify) an object: digest;
4. How to layout these objects within an image tar file.

**Media types**: every object defined in the spec can be identified by its [media type](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/media-types.md).

Now let's look at different parts of the `image-spec`. We'll first look at _descriptor_ and _digest_ since they're used by many other objects.
Then we'll follow a top-down approach to look at _image index_, _image manifest_, _image layers_ and _image config_.
We'll also look at the _image layout_ defined in the spec with an example image tar file.

## descriptor

> `application/vnd.oci.descriptor.v1+json` media type.
> A JSON object put in one object (e.g., image manifest) to reference another object (e.g., image config, layers).

An OCI image has different components such as image manifest, layers, etc, which are arranged in a DAG (Merkle tree).
The reference between components (e.g., image index -> image manifest -> layer) are described as [_(Content) Descriptor_](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/descriptor.md).

A descriptor specifies the type/identifier/size of the referenced content.
These fields are worth mentioning:

1. `mediaType`: unlike in other cases, the `mediaType` within a descriptor refers to the media type of the referenced content, not the object itself (i.e. the descriptor).
2. **`digest`**: the digest of the targeted object/content. For example, the digest within a descriptor in `.layers` of an `image manifest` means the the digest of the referenced layer.
3. `size`: the size of the targeted content.

### digest

> Digest itself is a broader concept that enables [content addressability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage). It's also a field of a descriptor.

[Digest](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/descriptor.md#digests) is a string that uniquely identifies content/bytes (e.g., a blob file, a string).
It's a concatenation of the hash algorithm name and the hash value calculated from the content using the hash algorithm (e.g. `sha256:6c3c624b58dbbcd3c0dd82b4c53f04194d1247c6eebdaab7c610cf7d66709b3b`).

It can also verify that the content (e.g., an image layer tar file) downloaded from a source (e.g. a registry) is the same bytes generated by the image builder.

## (optional) image index

> `application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json` media type.

[_Image index_](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-index.md) is a JSON object that simply references _image manifests_ or other _image indexes_ (nested index).
It acts as a single entrypoint for multiple images (for example, a multi-platform image).
A runtime can then choose one of the _image manifests_ referenced by the _image index_, based on the host environment.

_Image index_ defines the list of _image manifests/indexes_ referenced by it in the `manifests` field, which is a _descriptor_ array.
Each descriptor also has information and metadata such as `platform` that can be used by runtime to select a specific _image manifest/index_.

## image manifest

> `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json` media type.
> A JSON object describing an image or an artifact.

From the [_image manifest_ spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/manifest.md), it has 3 goals:

1. content-addressable image: image configuration content <-> unique ID;
2. multi-architecture images: use _image index_ as a fat manifest;
3. [translatable](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/conversion.md) to OCI `runtime-spec`.

The _image manifest_ spec looks complicated because it has generalized to a broader `manifest` spec which covers the main _image manifest_ AND the general _artifact manifest_.

> However, the `artifact` part hasn't been released and expected to be released as part of OCI image-spec 1.1.
> Some of the `artifact` related content are based on the main branch of the spec, which might be changed or even removed.
> Below we still use _image manifest_ to refer the whole spec, and only use `artifact` when necessary.

_Image manifest_ defines an specific image (or artifact) that is applicable to a specific arch+OS.
The following fields in the spec worth mentioning:

1. `config`: a descriptor that references an _image configuration_ object.
2. `layers`: a descriptor array.
3. `subject`: a descriptor referencing another manifest.
This is used by the [`referrers` API](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#listing-referrers) to indicate its relationship to the referenced manifest (imagine it as a pointer).
For example, an image signature artifact manifest uses `subject` to reference the image manifest it signs.
4. `artifactType`: a string indicating the type of artifact, when it's used as an artifact manifest instead of image manifest.

Another confusing point in the _image manifest_ spec is that it has many fields that define the media type of the specific component in the manifest, such as:

1. `.mediaType`: the media type of the manifest itself.
In most case, it should be `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json` for both `image` and `artifact` manifest.
2. `.artifactType`: the artifact type of the manifest, if not an image.
3. `.config.mediaType`: for image manifest, it should be `application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json`;
for artifact manifest, it should be a self-defined type (e.g., `application/vnd.example.config.v1+json`) or `application/vnd.oci.scratch.v1+json`.
4. `.layers.[].mediaType`: for image, it should be a layer media type such as `application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+gzip`;
for artifact, it should be a self-defined type that describe the data type of the artifact.
5. `.subject.mediaType`: the `mediaType` of the referenced manifest.

> It becomes more complicated when describing an artifact.
> See [the spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/manifest.md#guidelines-for-artifact-usage) for more details.

## (filesystem) layer

> `application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar`, `application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+gzip`, `application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+zstd`, etc media types.

A [layer](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/layer.md) describe a file system diff (add/remove/modify files), which can be applied on top of each other to construct a complete container file system.

Each layer is represented as a tar file (w, or w/o compression), which is also called a _changeset_.
For a base layer, it contains the initial file system content.

For child layers, it only contains file entries that are different (add/remove/modify) from its parent layer tar file.
Since layers are just tar files with regular file entries, we need to figure out how to represent file diffs that can be applied to parent layers:

1. Add a file/directory: simply add the file/directory to the specified location;
2. Modify a file/directory: similarly, overwrite the same file/directory with the new content;
3. Delete a file: use a special _whiteout_ marker file with a `.wh.` prefix.
For example, a tar entry named `./foo/.wh.bar.txt` means deleting the `./foo/bar.txt` file.
4. Delete a directory: use a _opaque whiteout_ marker file named `.wh..wh.opq`.
For example, a tar entry named `./foo/.wh..wh.opq` means deleting the `./foo/` directory.

By applying each tar file from base layer to the last child layer based on 1-4, we can get a complete file system specified by an image.

## image configuration

> `application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json` media type.

With an _image manifest_, we can identify a single image (layers + config) specific to an arch+OS;
with the layers, we can construct a complete file system from the image that can be used by a container.
However, we still miss metadata that is necessary to launch a container, such as environment variables or default arguments (uid, volumes, etc).

_Image configuration_ (also called _Image JSON_ in the spec) is a JSON object that contains all these metadata for an image.
It also defines the **order** of layers used to construct the file system.

First let's explain some concepts that are useful to understand the configuration:

**Image ID**: the digest of an image configuration JSON object.
The image ID makes images content-addressable, because the configuration JSON object contains the digests (actually DiffID) of each image layer.

**Layer DiffID**: the digest of a layer's uncompressed tar archive.
It's different from _layer digest_, which is the digest of a layer's compressed or uncompressed content depending the layer's format (tar, gzip, zstd).

**Layer ChainID**: the digest of a stack of ordered/chained layers.
It's calculated as follows:

```shell
ChainID(L_0) = DiffID(L_0)
ChainID(L_i) = Digest(ChainID(L_i-1) + " " + DiffID(L_i))
```

**Why we need both ChainID and DiffID?**
Because DiffID only identifies a single layer/changeset, with no information about it's parent/child layers.
If we use DiffID only, an attacker can replace a layer's parent layer with a malicious layer without changing the DiffID.
ChainID can resolve this because it's a hash of a unique stack of layers applied on top of each other.

Now let's look at the configuration JSON object.
The following fields worth mentioning:

1. `architecture` and `os`: both are strings specifying the arch+OS of the image;
2. `config` an optional JSON object (don't confused with the whole configuration JSON object) containing the base execution parameters when running a container.
Some example fields:
  a. `User` string: username/UID used to run the container;
  b. `Env` string array: environment variables;
  c. `Labels` object: arbitrary metadata for the container;
3. `rootfs` object: `rootfs.diff_ids` contains an array of layer DiffIDs from base layer to the top layer, making the image config hash depend on the file system / layers;

## manifest v.s. artifact v.s. descriptor v.s. digest

Being a non English-native speaker, I previously found these terms confusing (mostly due to my weak vocubulary 🥲).
So I just quickly summarize them here, mainly for my own reference :)

1. manifest: a JSON object that describes an image or artifact; in most cases, it refers an image manifest.
2. artifact: an arbitrary data blob that can be referenced by a manifest, and is content-addressable.
We can say an image is a special type of artifact. Other types of artifacts include image signature, SBOM, helm chart, etc.
3. descriptor: a JSON object describing the reference relationship between components (e.g. image manifest -> config, image manifest -> layer, etc).
It includes information to identify the referenced component, such as media type, digest, size, etc.
4. digest: a string (`hash_algorithm:hash_value`) that uniquely identifies a specific content/bytes, calcuated from the content using the given hash algorithm.

## image layout

[_Image layout_](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-layout.md) defines the the layout (i.e., the directory extracted from an OCI image tar file) of an OCI image.
Given an image layout and an image `ref` (e.g. an image id), an OCI runtime bundle can be created following:

1. Follow the `ref` to find a `manifest`;
2. Apply the layers in the specified order (by `rootfs.diff_ids` in `image-spec` config) to get the file system;
3. Convert `image-spec` config into an runtime-spec bundle `config.json`.

The image layout must contains:

1. `blobs` directory: contains all content-addressable blobs.
Each hash algorithm has its own sub-directory, within which are the blobs.
Each blob file is named to its content hash value.
So given a digest `<alg>:<hash>`, we can find the blob file at `blobs/<alg>/<hash>`.
2. `oci-layout` file: a JSON object (`application/vnd.oci.layout.header.v1+json` media type).
It marks and versions an OCI layout.
3. `index.json` file: an `image index` acting as an entry point to the image.
For example, given an image id (`ref`), we can find its `image manifest` from `index.json`'s `.manifests` field.

## An image layout example

Let's look at a real image and its layout. I'll use the `ubuntu:latest` image and `docker save` for convenience to get its content since I'm using a macbook.

First let's pull and save the image, and extract the image tar file to a directory:

```bash
$ docker pull ubuntu
$ docker save ubuntu -o ubuntu.tar
$ tar -C ./ubuntu -xvf ubuntu.tar
$ cd ubuntu
```

Then let's check all the files in the image directory:

```bash
$ find . -type f
./oci-layout
./blobs/sha256/537da24818633b45fcb65e5285a68c3ec1f3db25f5ae5476a7757bc8dfae92a3
./blobs/sha256/bab8ce5c00ca3ef91e0d3eb4c6e6d6ec7cffa9574c447fd8d54a8d96e7c1c80e
./blobs/sha256/cd741b12a7eaa64357041c2d3f4590c898313a7f8f65cd1577594e6ee03a8c38
./blobs/sha256/f2ef2e10c68c0d0c7a97d0c45076cd9549ac25cef6647b3a28487131066c406c
./manifest.json
./index.json
```

From the output, we can validate that the image layout contains required `blobs` directory and `index.json` and `oci-layout` files. And the `blobs` directory is organized by hash algorithm as sub-directories and hash value as file names.

> There is an extra file, `manifest.json`, which based on my understanding is not part of OCI image spec and only used by docker (i.e., it's part of [docker image spec](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/image/spec/v1.2.md) instead).

Now let's check the `oci-layout` and `index.json` files:

```bash
# oci-layout only defines layout version
$ cat oci-layout | jq
{
  "imageLayoutVersion": "1.0.0"
}
$ cat index.json | jq
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "manifests": [
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json",
      "digest": "sha256:f2ef2e10c68c0d0c7a97d0c45076cd9549ac25cef6647b3a28487131066c406c",
      "size": 304,
      "annotations": {
        "io.containerd.image.name": "docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest",
        "org.opencontainers.image.ref.name": "latest"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `index.json` contains only one manifest which is an `image index`. Let's find the index by following the `blobs/<alg>/<hash>` path based its digest:

```bash
$ cat blobs/sha256/f2ef2e10c68c0d0c7a97d0c45076cd9549ac25cef6647b3a28487131066c406c | jq
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json",
  "manifests": [
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
      "digest": "sha256:537da24818633b45fcb65e5285a68c3ec1f3db25f5ae5476a7757bc8dfae92a3",
      "size": 424,
      "platform": {
        "architecture": "arm64",
        "os": "linux",
        "variant": "v8"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This `image index`, similar to `index.json`, points to a single `image manifest`.
Doing the same, we have:

```bash
$ cat blobs/sha256/537da24818633b45fcb65e5285a68c3ec1f3db25f5ae5476a7757bc8dfae92a3 | jq
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
  "config": {
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json",
    "size": 2316,
    "digest": "sha256:bab8ce5c00ca3ef91e0d3eb4c6e6d6ec7cffa9574c447fd8d54a8d96e7c1c80e"
  },
  "layers": [
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+gzip",
      "size": 27347481,
      "digest": "sha256:cd741b12a7eaa64357041c2d3f4590c898313a7f8f65cd1577594e6ee03a8c38"
    }
  ]
}
```

As expected, the `image manifest` contains a `config` descriptor and a list of `layer` descriptors.
Let's check the `config` JSON object:

```bash
# I removed many details in the output for simplicity
$ cat blobs/sha256/bab8ce5c00ca3ef91e0d3eb4c6e6d6ec7cffa9574c447fd8d54a8d96e7c1c80e | jq
{
  "architecture": "arm64",
  "config": {
    "User": "",
    "Env": [
      "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
    ],
    "Cmd": [
      "/bin/bash"
    ],
    "Image": "sha256:e7deb3a6ff503af01d302e3ec352370e33ecb2cc064f08d2ca40c87ec02aa227",
  },
  "history": [
    {
      "created": "2023-03-08T04:32:38.832581437Z",
      "created_by": "/bin/sh -c #(nop)  ARG RELEASE",
      "empty_layer": true
    },
  ],
  "os": "linux",
  "rootfs": {
    "type": "layers",
    "diff_ids": [
      "sha256:874b048c963ab55b06939c39d59303fb975d323822a4ea48a02ac8dc635ea371"
    ]
  },
  "variant": "v8"
}
```

From the output, we can see there is one layer DiffID in `.rootfs.diff_ids` which matches length of `.layers` in the `image manifest`.
Notice for this layer, the layer digest is `sha256:cd741b12a7eaa64357041c2d3f4590c898313a7f8f65cd1577594e6ee03a8c38` and the DiffID is `sha256:874b048c963ab55b06939c39d59303fb975d323822a4ea48a02ac8dc635ea371`.

Now let's take a look at the layer and validate that the layer digest indeed matches its content (the same applies to other objects as well), and the layer DiffID matches the content of the uncompressed layer tar file:

```bash
# layer digest matches layer blob file
$ shasum -a 256 ./blobs/sha256/cd741b12a7eaa64357041c2d3f4590c898313a7f8f65cd1577594e6ee03a8c38
cd741b12a7eaa64357041c2d3f4590c898313a7f8f65cd1577594e6ee03a8c38  ./blobs/sha256/cd741b12a7eaa64357041c2d3f4590c898313a7f8f65cd1577594e6ee03a8c38
# layer DiffID matches the uncompressed layer tar file
$ gunzip -c ./blobs/sha256/cd741b12a7eaa64357041c2d3f4590c898313a7f8f65cd1577594e6ee03a8c38 | shasum -a 256
874b048c963ab55b06939c39d59303fb975d323822a4ea48a02ac8dc635ea371  -
```

So far, we checked 4 blobs: image index, image manifest, image config, and layer.
This is all blob files in `blobs/sha256` directory. In some cases, `blobs` may contain blob file not referenced by any descriptor.

```bash
$ find ./blobs/sha256 -type f
./blobs/sha256/537da24818633b45fcb65e5285a68c3ec1f3db25f5ae5476a7757bc8dfae92a3
./blobs/sha256/bab8ce5c00ca3ef91e0d3eb4c6e6d6ec7cffa9574c447fd8d54a8d96e7c1c80e
./blobs/sha256/cd741b12a7eaa64357041c2d3f4590c898313a7f8f65cd1577594e6ee03a8c38
./blobs/sha256/f2ef2e10c68c0d0c7a97d0c45076cd9549ac25cef6647b3a28487131066c406c
```

From this example, we can see how we can find all the blobs (image manifest, config, layer, etc) from a given image ref and how we can validate the integrity of each blob based on its digest.
